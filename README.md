# Data Structures and Algorithms Projects

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** projects implemented in **C++**.  
Each project demonstrates the application of fundamental and advanced algorithmic concepts through real-world problem simulations.  
All projects are well-documented, modular, and optimized for readability and performance — suitable for internship portfolios and technical interviews.
